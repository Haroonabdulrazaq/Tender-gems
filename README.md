This is design for primary school use, it include a webosite and an automatic result system. The result system allows the teacher to 
input student result and the system automatically generate the result and saves in a database(NOT PROVIDED BY GITHUB:::: SO YOU WILL 
SEE ERROR LIKE "405 NOT ALLOWED"). At the other end the parent can view their pupils(wards) result from their phones or laptop.
